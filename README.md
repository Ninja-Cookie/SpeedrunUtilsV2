# <p align="center">SpeedrunUtilsV2: A Bomb Rush Cyberfunk Speedrun Utility</p>

**SpeedrunUtilsV2** is a (non-required but very helpful for runners and verifiers) Speedrun Utility for [Bomb Rush Cyberfunk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1353230/Bomb_Rush_Cyberfunk/), allowed to be used in speedruns of the game.
This utility aims to make speedrunning BRC a lot friendlier, with features such as:
- Automatic interaction with [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/)
- Accurate Auto-Splitting
- Pausing time for loading screens automatically
- Cutscene skipping (with time automatically added on)
- In-Game FPS limit toggler
- General FPS configuration for capping or uncapping
- In-Game FPS Display

## How to use:
1. Either use [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/bomb-rush-cyberfunk/p/ebkr/r2modman/) or manually install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) by dragging the archived files directly into your "\BombRushCyberfunk" folder (where your game is installed), which should now have a "BepInEx" folder, and other files that came with it, in the same place as your "Bomb Rush Cyberfunk" executable.
2. (TODO: ADD RELEASE AND FINISH README)
